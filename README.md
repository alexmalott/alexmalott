### Hi!

I'm Alex Malott, currently a [Micro Focus*](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/home) Software Engineer.

I tend to focus on (web) UI these days, but have experience across the stack.  My current project heavily involves Helm, Kubernetes, and containers.

When I'm writing code on personal time, it's usually web-dev, adjacent to video game development or embedded systems.
